# Solipsism Frontend

This project is the frontend of the Solipsism project.
It was create as an experiment to understand the current capabilities of LLM generated code for web development.

This code DOES NOT represent my personal coding style or preferences, as it was generated by an LLM.
The chosen IDE was Google's Antigravity, for no particular reason besides being free.

As an experiment, it will be considered complete when it runs without evident errors, but there may be security vulnerabilities or other issues that I am not aware of.
